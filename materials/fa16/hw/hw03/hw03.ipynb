    "##### Weighing the traits\n",
    "After computing dissimilarities between several schools, you notice a problem with your method: the scale of the traits matters a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since schools cost tens of thousands of dollars to attend, the cost-to-attend trait is always a much bigger *number* than most other traits.  That makes it affect the dissimilarity a lot more than other traits.  Two schools that differ in cost-to-attend by \\$900, but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of 900.  But two schools that differ in graduation rate by .9 (a huge difference!), but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of only .9.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to fix this problem is to assign different \"weights\" to different traits.  For example, we could fix the problem above by multiplying the difference in the cost-to-attend traits by .001, so that a difference of \\$900 in cost-to-attend results in a dissimilarity of $900 \\times .001$, or $.9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a revised method that does that for every trait:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each trait, subtract the two schools' trait values.\n",
    "2. Then take the absolute value of that difference.\n",
    "3. *Now multiply that absolute value by a trait-specific number, like .001 or 2.*\n",
    "4. Now sum the 1000 resulting numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4.** Suppose you've already decided on a weight for each trait.  These are loaded into an array called `weights` in the cell below.  `weights.item(0)` is the weight for the first trait, `weights.item(1)` is the weight for the second trait, and so on.  Use the revised method to compute a revised dissimilarity between Berkeley and Stanford.\n",
